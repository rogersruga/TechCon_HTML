            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>TechCon began as a small community meetup in 2016, formed by a collective of local developers,
               students, and innovators who shared one goal—creating a space where technology enthusiasts could
               learn, collaborate, and showcase new ideas. What started as a single-room gathering with a few
               guest speakers quickly grew into an annual tradition that attracted participants from across the
               region.</p>
